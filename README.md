# Maleficarum Storage

This component replaces the now obsolete Maleficarum Database compoment (https://github.com/pharaun13/maleficarum-database). All MSSQL code was removed and persistence layers were decoupled from actual model objects. Additionally generic Redis model/collection repository was implemented and provided as basis for project specific implementations.

# Change Log
## [3.3.1] - 2020-05-07
## Added
- Added connection check in deleteAll method in Postgresql collection repository

## [3.3.0] - 2020-04-20
## Added
- useCache flag on Postgres Collection and Model constructors to control PDO caching mechanism in underneath populate function

# Change Log
## [3.2.0] - 2020-01-02
## Added
- Flag to avoid PDO statements local caching

## [3.1.0] - 2018-11-08
## Added
- Added hScan, zScan, sScan methods for redis connection

## [3.0.0] - 2018-10-23
## Added
- Added connection retry logic when connecting to postgresql shards. (number of retries can be set via the constructor and/or initializer)
- Added connection retry login when connecting to redis shards. (number of retries can be set via the constructor and/or initializer)
- Added an option to specify connection timeout for postgresql connections.
- Added an option to specify connection timeout for redis connections.

## [2.2.0] - 2018-09-20
### Added
- Added a way to retrieve the list of all shards of a specified type from the shard manager.
- Added an implementation of the scan method to the Redis connection object (it needs a reference call so the magic implementation was insufficient)
### Fixed
- Incorrect exception message when attempting to execute logic methods on disconnected redis connection objects.

## [2.1.0] - 2018-09-10
### Added
- Added a way to inject custom shard selectors to data repositories. Shard selection will no longer lie within the interests of data models.
- Bumped Maleficarum\Data dependency to 4.X+

## [2.0.3] - 2018-09-06
### Changed
- Performance optimization: a single shard definition will only result in one shard connection, regardless of how many non-default routes point to that shard definition.

## [2.0.2] - 2018-09-05
### Added
- Automatic parameter type detection when binding boolean parameters in Postgresql shards.

## [2.0.1] - 2018-09-05
### Fixed
- Fixed a bug that resulted in shard statements being shared across shard connections. 

## [2.0.0] - 2018-09-05
### Changed
- Component updated to work with Maleficarum\Ioc 3.X
